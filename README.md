## Features
**MOAR TABS**
Firefox reStock allows for tabs to become significantly smaller than possible under normal circumstances. It is closer to how chrome handles it, and way better for people who use lots of tabs at once.

**Less distraction**
Firefox reStock removes unnessesary borders and lines from menus and buttons, making Firefox look a bit cleaner
