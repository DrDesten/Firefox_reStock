The currently selected tab expands a bit, allowing for more information to be displayed.

**Less distraction** <br>
Firefox reStock removes unnessesary borders and lines from menus and buttons, making Firefox look a bit cleaner

**Animations** <br>
Firefox reStock adds smooth animations when selecting or hovering above tabs, aswell as to some menu items and the navbar.
